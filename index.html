        <h1>Fantasy NBA Finals</h1>
        <h2>Comic Book Panel</h2>
        <p>I chose to create a fantasy NBA finals game. These teams could have never played each other for one was together in the early 2000's and the other in th back end of the decade. I used photoshop to alter the majority of pictures, as well as illustrator for the text. I felt digital imaging was the best way to pit these 2 teams against each other.</p>
